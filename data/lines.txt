17	eliz	I don't pretend to know
17	eliz	the challenges you're facing.
17	eliz	The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind.
17	eliz	But I'm not afraid.
17	eliz	I know who I married.
17	eliz	So long as you come home at the end of the day
17	eliz	that would be enough.
17	eliz	We don't need a legacy.
17	eliz	We don't need money.
17	eliz	If I could grant you peace of mind,
17	eliz	If you could let me inside your heart...
17	eliz	Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
17	eliz	in the story they will write someday.

23	burr	In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays,
23	burr	in the span of six months.

24	jef	So what'd I miss?
24	jef	What'd I miss?
24	jef	Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss.
24	jef	I've been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
24	jef	I guess I basic'lly missed the late eighties...
24	jef	I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this...
24	ens	Aaa-ooo!

24	jef	Haven't even put my bags down yet.
24	jef	Sally be a lamb, darlin', won'tcha open it?
24	jef	It says the President's assembling a cabinet

24	jef	Uh...France.
24	mad	We have to win.

24	wash	Mr. Jefferson, welcome home.
24	ham	Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton.
24	wash	Mr. Jefferson, welcome home.
24	ens	Mr. Jefferson, welcome home.
24	comp	Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
24	comp	Sir, you've been off in Paris for so long!
24	jef	So what did I miss?
25	wash	Ladies and gentlemen,
25	wash	you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight,
25	wash	but you're here with us in New York City.
25	wash	Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???
25	wash	The issue on the table:
25	wash	Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt
25	wash	and establish a national bank.
25	wash	Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor.
25	jef	'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'
25	jef	We fought for these ideals; we shouldn't settle for less.
25	jef	These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em.
25	jef	Don't act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote 'em.
25	jef	Oww
25	mad	Oww
25	jef	But Hamilton forgets
25	jef	his plan would have the government assume state's debts.
25	jef	Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
25	jef	the very seat of government where Hamilton sits.
25	ham	Not true!
25	jef	Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it.
25	jef	If New York's in debt--
25	jef	why should Virginia bear it?
25	jef	Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid.
25	jef	Don't tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade.
25	jef	In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground.
25	jef	We create. You just wanna move our money around.
25	jef	This financial plan is an outrageous demand,
25	jef	and it's too many damn pages for any man to understand.
25	jef	Stand with me in the land of the free
25	jef	and pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy.
25	jef	Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky.
25	jef	Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky.
25	wash	Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response.
25	ham	Thomas. That was a real nice declaration.
25	ham	Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation.
25	ham	Would you like to join us, or stay mellow,
25	ham	Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
25	ham	If we assume the debts, the union gets
25	ham	A new line of credit, a financial diuretic.
25	ham	How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
25	ham	The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
25	ham	A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor,
25	ham	Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor.
25	ham	"We plant seeds in the South. We create."
25	ham	Yeah, keep ranting,
25	ham	we know who's really doing the planting.
25	ham	And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment,
25	ham	Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it.
25	ham	You think I'm frightened of you, man?
25	ham	We almost died in a trench
25	ham	while you were off getting high with the French.
25	ham	Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President,
25	ham	reticent--there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison.
25	ham	Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine.
25	ham	Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in,
25	ham	sittin' there useless as two shits.
25	ham	Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you where my shoe fits.
25	wash	Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk!
25	wash	Hamilton, take a walk!
25	wash	We'll reconvene after a brief recess.
25	wash	Hamilton!
25	ham	Sir!
25	wash	A word.
25	mad	You don't have the votes.
25	jef	You don't have the votes.
25	mad	You don't have the votes.
25	jef	Aha-ha-ha ha!
25	jef	You're gonna need congressional approval
25	mad	You're gonna need congressional approval
25	jef	and you don't have the votes.
25	mad	and you don't have the votes.
25	jef	Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder
25	mad	Why he even brings the thunder...
25	ham	I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather.
25	wash	Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth.
25	ham	So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
25	wash	You need the votes.
25	ham	No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.
25	wash	No, you need to convince more folks.
25	ham	James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter.
25	wash	Winning was easy, young man. Governing's harder.
25	ham	They're being intransigent.
25	wash	You have to find a compromise.
25	ham	But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!
25	wash	Convince them otherwise.
25	ham	What happens if I don't get congressional approval?
25	wash	I imagine they'll call for your removal.
25	ham	Sir--
25	wash	Figure it out, Alexander. That's an order from your commander.

27	burr	Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty.
27	burr	There's trouble in the air, you can smell it.
27	burr	and Alexander's by himself. I'll let him tell it.
27	ham	I hadn't slept in a week.
27	ham	I was weak, I was awake.
27	ham	You never seen a bastard orphan
27	ham	more in need of a break.
27	ham	Longing for Angelica.
27	ham	Missing my wife.
27	ham	That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life,
27	ham	she said:
27	mar	I know you are a man of honor,
27	mar	I'm so sorry to bother you at home
27	mar	but I don't know where to go,
27	mar	and I came here all alone...
27	ham	She said:
27	mar	My husband's doin' me wrong
27	mar	beatin' me, cheatin' me, mistreatin' me...
27	mar	Suddenly he's up and gone.
27	mar	I don't have the means to go on.
27	ham	So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home,
27	ham	she said
27	mar	You're too kind, sir.
27	ham	I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away,
27	ham	she lived a block away, she said:
27	mar	This one's mine, sir.
27	ham	Then I said, "well, I should head back home,"
27	ham	she turned red, she led me to her bed,
27	ham	let her legs spread and said:
27	mar	Stay?
27	ham	Hey...
27	mar	Hey...
27	ham	That's when I began to pray:
27	ham	Lord, show me how to say no to this.
27	ham	I don't know how to say no to this.
27	ham	But my God, she looks so helpless
27	ham	And her body's saying, "hell, yes"
27	mar	Whoa...
27	ham	Nooo, show me how to say no to this.
27	ham	Say no to this.
27	ham	I don't know how to say no to this.
27	ham	Say no to this.
27	ens	Say no to this.
27	ham	In my mind, I'm tryin' to go
27	ens	Go! Go! Go!

27	ens	Say no to this!
27	ens	No! No!

27	ens	No! No!
27	ens	Say no to this!
27	ham	I wish I could say that was the last time.
27	ham	I said that last time. It became a pastime.
27	ham	A month into this endeavor I received a letter
27	ham	from a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:
27	reyn	Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health,
27	reyn	and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
27	reyn	in the pockets of people like me: down on their luck.
27	reyn	You see, that was my wife who you decided to
27	ham	Fuuuu--
27	reyn	Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold,
27	reyn	so time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled.
27	reyn	And hey, you can keep seein' my whore wife
27	reyn	if the price is right: if not I'm telling your wife.
27	ham	I hid the letter and I raced to her place,
27	ham	screamed "How could you?!" in her face,
27	ham	she said:
27	mar	No, sir!
27	ham	Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked pathetic,
27	ham	she cried:
27	mar	Please don't go, sir!
27	ham	So was your whole story a setup?
27	mar	I don't know about any letter!
27	ham	Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!
27	mar	I didn't know any better
27	ham	I am ruined...
27	mar	Please don't leave me with him helpless.
27	ham	I am helpless--how could I do this?
27	mar	Just give him what he wants and you can have me.
27	ham	I don't want you
27	mar	Whatever you want,
27	ham	I don't want you
27	mar	If you pay,
27	ham	I don't...
27	mar	You can stay.
27	ham	Lord, show me how to say no to this.
27	ens	Say no to this!
27	mar	Tonight
27	ham	I don't know how to say no to this.
27	ens	Say no to this!
27	ham	Cuz the situation's helpless.
27	mar	Helpless.
27	ham	And her body's screaming, "Hell, yes"
27	mar	Whoa!
27	ham	No, show me how to say no to this.
27	ens	Say no to this!
27	ham	How can I say no to this?
27	mar	How can you say no to this?
27	ens	Say no to this!
27	ham	There is nowhere I can go.
27	ens	Go! Go! Go!
27	ham	When her body's on mine
27	ham	I do not say...

27	mar	Go go go...
27	reyn	So?
27	ham	Nobody needs to know.
28	burr	Ah, Mister Secretary.
28	ham	Mister Burr, sir.
28	burr	Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?
28	ham	No.
28	burr	You know Clermont Street?
28	ham	Yeah.
28	burr	They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure.
28	ham	Sure.
28	burr	And all he had to do was die.
28	ham	That's a lot less work.
28	burr	We oughta give it a try.
28	ham	Ha.
28	burr	Now how're you gonna get your debt plan through?
28	ham	I guess I'm gonna fin'ly have to listen to you.

28	burr	Ha.

28	jef	Oh-ho!

29	burr	Beware: it goeth before the fall...
30	wash	The issue on the table: France is on the verge
30	wash	of war with England. Do we provide aid and
30	wash	troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it?
30	wash	Remember, my decision on this matter
30	wash	is not subject to congressional approval.
30	wash	The only person you have to convince is me.
30	wash	Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.
30	jef	When we were on death's door, when we were needy,
30	jef	we made a promise, we signed a treaty.
30	jef	We needed money and guns and half a chance.
30	jef	Who provided those funds?
30	mad	France.
30	jef	In return, they didn't ask for land,
30	jef	only a promise that we'd lend a hand
30	jef	and stand with them if they fought against oppressors,
30	jef	and revolution is messy but now is the time to stand.
30	jef	Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny.
30	jef	I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
30	jef	would rather not have this debate.
30	jef	I'll remind you that he is not Secretary of State.
30	jef	He knows nothing of loyalty,
30	jef	smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty,
30	jef	desperate to rise above his station,
30	jef	everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation.
30	ens	Ooh!!
30	jef	Hey, and if ya don't know, now ya know, Mr. President.
30	wash	Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary
30	wash	Hamilton, your response.
30	ham	You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
30	ham	the President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
30	ham	of meddling in the middle of a military mess,
30	ham	a game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless.
30	ham	We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket.
30	ham	Would you like to take it out and ask it?
30	ham	"Should we honor our treaty, King Louis' head?"
30	ham	"Uh... do whatever you want, I'm super dead."
30	wash	Enough. Hamilton is right.
30	jef	Mr. President--
30	wash	We're too fragile to start another fight.
30	jef	But sir, do we not fight for freedom?
30	wash	Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em.
30	jef	The people are leading--
30	wash	The people are rioting.
30	wash	There's a difference. Frankly, it's a little disquieting
30	wash	you would let your ideals blind you to reality.
30	wash	Hamilton.
30	ham	Sir.
30	wash	Draft a statement of neutrality.
30	jef	Did you forget Lafayette?
30	ham	What?
30	jef	Have you an ounce of regret?
30	jef	You accumulate debt, you accumulate power,
30	jef	yet in their hour of need, you forget.
30	ham	Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine.
30	ham	And before he was your friend, he was mine.
30	ham	If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop.
30	ham	Where do we draw the line?
30	jef	So quick-witted.
30	ham	Alas, I admit it.
30	jef	I bet you were quite a lawyer.
30	ham	My defendants got acquitted.
30	jef	Huh. Well, someone oughta remind you.
30	ham	What?
30	jef	You're nothing without Washington behind you.
30	wash	Hamilton!
30	jef	Daddy's calling.
31	burr	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	burr	to have Washington on your side
31	burr	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	burr	to have Washington on your side.
31	jef	Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.
31	jef	Thanks to Hamilton, our cab'net's fractured into factions.
31	jef	Try not to crack under the stress,
31	jef	we're breaking down like fractions.
31	jef	We smack each other in the press,
31	jef	and we don't print retractions.
31	jef	I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion.
31	jef	The way he primps and preens and dresses
31	jef	like the pits of fashion.
31	jef	Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
31	jef	as Wall Street robs 'em blind in search of chips to cash in.
31	jef	This prick is askin' for someone to bring him to task.
31	jef	Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him.
31	jef	I'll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it.
31	jef	While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket.
31	jef	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	burr	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	jef	to have Washington on your side.
31	burr	to have Washington on your side.
31	jef	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	burr	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	jef	to have Washington on your side.
31	burr	to have Washington on your side.
31	jef	Look back at the Bill of Rights.
31	burr	Look back at the Bill of Rights.
31	jef	Which I wrote.
31	jef	The ink hasn't dried.
31	mad	The ink hasn't dried.
31	burr	The ink hasn't dried.

31	burr	It must be nice, it must be nice
31	jef	to have Washington on your side.
31	mad	to have Washington on your side.
31	burr	to have Washington on your side.
31	mad	So he's doubled the size of the government.
31	mad	Wasn't the trouble with much our previous government size?
31	burr	Look in his eyes!
31	jef	See how he lies.
31	mad	Follow the scent of his enterprise.
31	jef	Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive.
31	mad	If we don't stop it we aid and abet it.
31	jef	I have to resign.
31	mad	Somebody has to stand up for the South!
31	burr	Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
31	jef	If there's a fire you're trying to douse,
31	jef	You can't put it out from inside the house.
31	mad	You can't put it out from inside the house.
31	jef	I'm in the cabinet. I am complicit in
31	jef	watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.
31	jef	If Washington isn't gon' listen to disciplined dissidents,
31	jef	this is the difference:
31	jef	This kid is out!
31	mad	Oh!

39	phil	I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
39	phil	The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!

39	phil	Ladies, I'm lookin for a Mr. George Eacker.

39	phil	I can't have that, I'm making my father proud.
39	wom1	I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks.
39	wom1	He was goin' to see a play.
39	phil	Well, I'll go visit his box.

39	phil	I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel.
39	phil	They don't exactly cover this subject in boarding school.
39	ham	Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?
39	phil	He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease.

39	phil	Across the river, in Jersey.
39	ham	Everything is legal in New Jersey...
39	phil	Everything is legal in New Jersey...

39	ham	When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air.
39	ham	This will put an end to the whole affair.
39	phil	But what if he decides to shoot? Then I'm a goner.
39	ham	No. He'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor.
39	ham	To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake.
39	ham	Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak.
39	phil	Father--
39	ham	Promise me. You don't want this young man's blood on your conscience.
39	phil	Okay, I promise.

39	phil	My name is Philip
39	phil	I am a poet
39	phil	I'm a little nervous, but I can't show it.
39	phil	I'm sorry, I'm a Hamilton with pride.
39	phil	You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide.
39	phil	Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

42	mad	Ask him a question: it glances off,
42	mad	he obfuscates, he dances.
42	jef	And they say I'm a Francophile:

45	comp	Most disputes die and no one shoots!
45	comp	Number four!

45	burr	Looking,to the world, like a man on a mission.

45	comp	Five!

45	ham	record straight.
45	men	record straight.
45	burr	They won't teach you this in your classes,
45	burr	but look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses.
45	burr	Why? If not to take deadly aim?
45	burr	It's him or me, the world will never be the same.
45	burr	I had only one thought before the slaughter:
45	burr	This man will not make an orphan of my daughter.
45	comp	Number nine!
45	burr	Look him in the eye, aim no higher.
45	burr	Summon all the courage you require.

45	comp	One two three four five six seven eight nine
45	comp	Number ten paces! Fire!--
45	ham	I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory.
45	ham	Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev'ral feet ahead of me?
45	ham	I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
45	ham	There is no beat, no melody.
45	ham	Burr, my first friend, my enemy,
45	ham	maybe the last face I ever see,
45	ham	If I throw away my shot, is this how you remember me?
45	ham	What if this bullet is my legacy?
45	ham	Legacy. What is a legacy?
